# 🔄 Feedback-Aware Infrastructure Load Forecasting

A sophisticated forecasting system that accounts for feedback loops between infrastructure forecasts, capacity allocation decisions, and engineering team behavior. This solution addresses the critical challenge where forecasts themselves influence the outcomes they're trying to predict, creating endogeneity that traditional forecasting methods cannot handle.

## 🎯 The Feedback Loop Problem

In infrastructure forecasting, a unique challenge emerges:
1. **Forecasts drive capacity allocation** decisions
2. **Capacity constraints influence engineering behavior** (launch delays, optimization efforts)
3. **Engineering behavior changes actual demand patterns**
4. **Changed patterns invalidate the original forecasts**

This creates a **self-referential system** where naive forecasting approaches fail because they don't account for their own impact on the system.

## 🚀 Solution Overview

Our feedback-aware approach combines:

### 🧠 Behavioral Modeling
- **Engineering Response Models**: Predict how teams react to capacity constraints
- **Launch Delay Patterns**: Quantify when and how product launches get postponed
- **Optimization Behaviors**: Model efficiency improvements under pressure
- **Capacity Allocation Responses**: Understand how infrastructure teams scale

### ⚖️ Equilibrium Solving
- **Iterative Convergence**: Find stable states where forecasts align with actual outcomes
- **Game-Theoretic Analysis**: Model multi-team interactions and Nash equilibria
- **Policy Optimization**: Design capacity allocation strategies that minimize oscillations
- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: Separate endogenous effects from exogenous demand

### 📊 System Dynamics Analysis
- **Feedback Loop Quantification**: Measure the strength of self-referential effects
- **Stability Assessment**: Evaluate system tendency toward stable vs. chaotic behavior

### Basic Feedback-Aware Forecasting

```python
from feedback_aware_load_forecaster import FeedbackAwareLoadForecaster

# Initialize forecaster
forecaster = FeedbackAwareLoadForecaster()

# Generate historical data with feedback effects
historical_data = forecaster.generate_historical_feedback_data(periods=100)

# Analyze feedback patterns
feedback_analysis = forecaster.analyze_feedback_patterns(historical_data)

# Train behavioral models
forecaster.fit_behavior_models(historical_data)

# Generate equilibrium-based forecasts
base_forecasts = {day: 500 * (1.02 ** (day/7)) for day in range(30)}
forecasts = forecaster.forecast_with_feedback_awareness(
    base_forecasts, 
    current_capacity=1000, 
    horizon_days=30
)

print(f"Naive forecast: {forecasts['naive_forecast'].mean():.0f} GPU-hours")
print(f"Feedback-aware: {forecasts['feedback_aware_forecast'].mean():.0f} GPU-hours")
print(f"Feedback effect: {(forecasts['naive_forecast'] - forecasts['feedback_aware_forecast']).mean():.0f} GPU-hours")
```

### Advanced Equilibrium Analysis

# Predict equilibrium state for specific scenario
equilibrium = forecaster.predict_equilibrium_state(
    base_demand=800,           # Base infrastructure need
    planned_launches=300,      # Additional demand from launches
    current_capacity=1200,     # Available GPU capacity
    market_conditions={'volatility': 1.1, 'competitor_actions': 1}
)

print(f"Equilibrium demand: {equilibrium['demand']:.0f} GPU-hours")
print(f"Utilization: {equilibrium['utilization']:.1%}")
print(f"Launch delays: {equilibrium['launch_delays']:.1%}")
print(f"Efficiency gains: {equilibrium['efficiency_gains']:.1%}")
```

# Optimize capacity allocation policy
optimal_policy = forecaster.optimize_capacity_policy(historical_data)

# Simulate policy impact
policy_impact = forecaster.simulate_policy_impact(optimal_policy)

print(f"Optimal target utilization: {optimal_policy['target_utilization']:.1%}")
print(f"Expected improvement: {policy_impact['improvements']['utilization_improvement_pct']:.1f}%")
