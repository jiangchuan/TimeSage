## Installation

```bash
# Core dependencies
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
pip install prophet xgboost scikit-learn
pip install ruptures  # For changepoint detection

# Optional: Enhanced plotting
pip install seaborn plotly
```

## Quick Start

```python
from api_usage_forecast import APIUsageForecast

# Initialize the forecasting system
forecaster = APIUsageForecast()

# Run complete analysis pipeline
results = forecaster.run_complete_analysis()

# Access individual components
data = results['data']
forecasts = results['forecasts'] 
scenarios = results['scenarios']
compute_requirements = results['compute_requirements']
```

## Core Components

### 1. Data Generation and Analysis
```python
# Generate realistic sample data
data = forecaster.generate_sample_data(days=365)

# Analyze usage patterns by model
data_with_analysis = forecaster.decompose_usage_by_model(data)
```

### 2. Changepoint Detection
```python
# Detect significant shifts in usage patterns
changepoints = forecaster.detect_changepoints(data)

# Changepoints inform model building and scenario creation
```

### 3. Multi-Model Forecasting
```python
# Build Prophet models with external regressors
prophet_model = forecaster.build_prophet_model(data, 'total_usage')

# Build XGBoost models with feature engineering
xgb_model, features = forecaster.build_xgboost_model(data, 'total_usage')

# Generate 90-day forecasts
forecasts = forecaster.generate_forecasts(data, forecast_days=90)
```

### 4. Scenario Planning
```python
# Create migration scenarios based on changepoint analysis
scenarios = forecaster.create_scenarios(data, forecast_days=90)

# Visualize scenarios and compute requirements
compute_reqs = forecaster.visualize_scenarios(data)
```

## Model Features

### Prophet Model
- **Seasonality**: Daily, weekly, and yearly patterns
- **External Regressors**: Pricing impact, media coverage, weekend effects
- **Changepoints**: Incorporates detected usage shifts
- **Uncertainty**: Built-in confidence intervals

### XGBoost Model
- **Feature Engineering**: Lag features, moving averages, cyclical encoding
- **Changepoint Features**: Binary indicators and time-since-changepoint
- **Launch Effects**: Post-launch adoption indicators
- **Iterative Forecasting**: Multi-step ahead predictions

## External Factors

The system incorporates several external factors that influence API usage:

- **Pricing Changes**: Impact on adoption rates
- **Media Coverage**: Launch buzz and publicity effects  
- **Documentation**: Quality and availability of resources
- **Seasonality**: Day-of-week and monthly patterns
- **Launch Timeline**: Pre/post-launch dynamics

## Scenario Types

### Baseline Scenario
- Moderate migration pace based on historical patterns
- Standard adoption curves
- Balanced infrastructure scaling

### Slow Migration Scenario  
- Conservative user adoption

- Weekend vs weekday patterns

### Infrastructure Recommendations
- Compute scaling requirements (40-80% for aggressive scenarios)
- Dynamic scaling triggers
- Cost optimization strategies
- Monitoring and alerting setup

### Executive Summary
Automatically generated summary including:
- Current state analysis

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Data Integration
```python
# Use your own data instead of generated samples
custom_data = pd.read_csv('your_api_usage_data.csv')

# Ensure required columns: date, figurex35_usage, figurex4o_usage, etc.
forecaster.decompose_usage_by_model(custom_data)
```

### Model Customization
```python
# Adjust Prophet parameters
model = Prophet(
    changepoint_prior_scale=0.2,  # Higher for more flexible changepoints
    seasonality_prior_scale=15,    # Higher for stronger seasonality
    yearly_seasonality=False       # Disable if not relevant
)

# Customize XGBoost features
feature_cols = ['pricing_impact', 'media_coverage', 'custom_feature']
```

### Scenario Customization
```python
# Create custom scenarios with specific parameters
custom_scenarios = {
    'conservative': (0.005, 0.05),  # (decline_rate, growth_rate)
    'moderate': (0.02, 0.15),
    'aggressive': (0.08, 0.30)
}
```

### Monitoring Recommendations
- Real-time usage dashboards
- Automated changepoint detection
- Weekly migration rate tracking
- Capacity utilization alerts

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Missing ruptures package:**
```bash
pip install ruptures
```

**Memory issues with large datasets:**
- Reduce sample size in `generate_sample_data()`
- Use data chunking for very large datasets
- Consider using Dask for distributed processing

**Poor forecast accuracy:**
- Check for data quality issues
- Adjust changepoint detection sensitivity
- Include additional external regressors
- Extend historical data period

### Model Validation
```python
# Check model performance
from sklearn.metrics import mean_absolute_error

# Split data for validation
train_data = data[:-30]  # All but last 30 days
test_data = data[-30:]   # Last 30 days

# Train on subset and validate
model_performance = forecaster.validate_models(train_data, test_data)
```
